Surface-Profilometry-Analyzer
Welcome to the Surface-Profilometry-Analyzer repository! This project contains Python programs designed to analyze surface profilometry images. The primary goal is to extract and compute key surface parameters, such as surface roughness and waviness, which are critical in various fields including materials science, engineering, and manufacturing.

Features
Image Processing and Analysis
Image Loading and Preprocessing: Functions to load and preprocess surface profilometry images for analysis.
Noise Reduction: Algorithms to reduce noise and enhance image quality, ensuring accurate parameter extraction.
Segmentation: Techniques to segment the surface profile into meaningful regions for detailed analysis.
Surface Parameter Calculation
Surface Roughness: Calculation of surface roughness parameters (Ra, Rq, Rz, etc.), which quantify the deviations in the surface profile.
Surface Waviness: Measurement of surface waviness, capturing the broader undulations on the surface.
Profile Statistics: Extraction of statistical measures (mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis) from the surface profile.
Visualization Tools
2D and 3D Plots: Generation of 2D and 3D plots of the surface profile for visual inspection and presentation.
Histograms and Distribution Plots: Visualization of the distribution of surface heights and other relevant statistics.
Data Export
Report Generation: Automated generation of reports summarizing the key parameters and visualizations.
Export Options: Options to export the analysis results and plots in various formats (CSV, Excel, PDF, etc.).
